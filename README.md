# Data Visualisation Project

This group project was part of the course 2491 Data Visualisation at the Nova School of Business and Economics 19/20 taught by Professors Qiwei Han and Inigo de Troya. 
We, as a team, have been assigned a collection of big datasets on the movie industry. 
(For all the data contact: alessandro.gambetti4@gmail.com, I can manage to share it.)
The goal of the research was to elaborate information and to extract non-obvious conclusions thourgh what can be mined using visualisation libraries. 

The evaluation was based on a midterm and on a final project: a notebook is provided for each evaluation. 

process-final.ipynb is the key file of the repository in which are written all the comments and "how we get to the point" at each step of the work. 
All the work has been conducted on the Google Colab environment. 

Special thanks to my colleagues! We managed to form a collaborative team and we were able to be productive at each step of the journey! I had fun and enjoyed a lot!
